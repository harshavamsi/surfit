            <h3 >What is The Pursuit?</h3>
			<p style="font-size:18px; " class="text-left">The Pursuit is a bi-annual online treasure hunt conducted by the PESITSouth ACM Student Chapter. We're back with the 4th iteration this year and we're bigger than ever :D

            </p>

			<h3>Rules</h3>
			<p style="font-size:18px;" class="text-left">

            The rules are pretty much the same for those who have played the previous editions of The Pursuit. But there are a few more things we have added that we feel might have been missed out on earlier occasions. Please read carefully :)
            </p>
<ul style="font-size:16px;">
    <li>

    The game play involves getting to the next level by whatever means necessary.
    </li>
<li>

There is only one way to get across levels -
Entering the answer in the text box.
Changing URL's will not work :P
</li>
<li>
    Answers are not case sensitive. In case the answer contains more than one word, do not forget to include spaces.
</li>
<li>

    We try to cover most possible answers to a level, but do try out different combinations of answers.
</li>
<li>
    Google is your best friend :D If you're stuck on a question, check inGenius 2016 Facebook page for hints.
</li>
<li>
    We have observed, based on experiences from the previous versions of The Pursuit, that in spite of getting the right answers, players refuse to enter them and try them out! We have no restrictions on the number of attempts, so do abuse this rule outrightly
</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:18px;" class="text-left">

What are you waiting for? Start your Pursuit!
